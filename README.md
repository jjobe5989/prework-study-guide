# Prework Study GUide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for Bootcamp prework. I created this to help other students who may not understand as well as I did. This helps guide students through the beggining steps of the bootcamp. Making this I learn about HTML, CSS, and a whole bunch of JavaScript.

To use this application their are 2 ways. The first way to review is to simply read over the notes displayed on the page, but if you dont know where to start, this is where the second option comes in. First, open the Chrome DevTools by either pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). Once your in find your way to the console tab at the top of the control panel. There you can see a list of topics and at the bottom of the list it says "Which topic should we study first?", below this you will see a topic that will change everytime you refresh the page.
